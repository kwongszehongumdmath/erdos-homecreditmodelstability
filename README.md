# Predicting loan default - Credit risk model stabiity

# Overview
Borrowing has been a common financial activity in the modern society. It is therefore important for lending institutions to have an accurate and stable way to assess the default risk of each client. This year, Home Credit, an international consumer finance provider hosted a Kaggle competition again. The aim is to look for a model predicting loan risk whose performance is stable over time, and our group takes this up as our project.

The dataset can be found in the [competition website](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability).

# Modelling approach
We employ the following models:
1. XGBoost
2. MLP Classifier and
3. LightGBM
